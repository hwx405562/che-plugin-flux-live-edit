## How to run the demo with Eclipse Che 3.x:

I've made available a Docker container with Eclipse Che and the Eclipse Flux plugin.

### Run che with docker:

    docker run ......

You may need to update the .che/che.properties, and replace `localhost` by the IP or domain name of your instance.

### Add a new Dockerfile
